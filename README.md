# Online-Store

This is an online store that you can browse, add to cart, and order a variaty of different items. You will need to npm install the node modules to run this. Also sense I used mySQL I put the connection information for that in the .variables file. If anyone wants to play around with the site and test it out further, message me and I can find some way of letting you use the site fully but keep all of the Database information to myself.
